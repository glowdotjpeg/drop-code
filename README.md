# DropCode

A warm, drop-down AI coding terminal for macOS.

![DropCode](docs/dropcode.png)

DropCode embeds [`libghostty`](https://ghostty.org) and starts its terminal
session when the app launches, so your agent is ready before the panel appears.
Ghostty.app is not required.

- Tap `Control+Command` to toggle the panel.
- Hold `Control+Command` to show it until you release the keys.
- Launch OpenCode, Codex, Claude, or any custom shell command.
- Adjust panel height, centered width, and window opacity from settings.
- Forward terminal completion requests to macOS desktop notifications.
- Keep the colors and theme configured by the launched CLI.

For OpenCode completion alerts, enable **Desktop notifications** in DropCode
and enable **Attention** in OpenCode settings. Other launchers work when they
emit standard OSC desktop-notification sequences.
